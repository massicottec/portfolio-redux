# Portfolio Creation

The creation of this portfolio website is to show off what I've learned to date by creating a webpage that will display that knowledge all from scratch.

## Motivation

This was the start of a personal portfolio for future use.  It both brings all of my development experience into one locale, but also demonstrates the kind of experience that I have obtained on my coding journey.
